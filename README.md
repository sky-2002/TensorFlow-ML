# TensorFlow-ML
A repository for my ML projects using tensorflow.

### 1. [PubMedNLP](https://github.com/sky-2002/TensorFlow-ML/tree/master/PubMedNLP)
- This project is based on NLP, particularly sequential sentence classification as belonging to the #BACKGROUND, #CONCLUSION, #RESULT and other such sections 
of the papers in PubMEd RCT dataset. Classifying sentences in the abstracts can make them more organized and easy to read.


### 2. [BitPredict](https://github.com/sky-2002/TensorFlow-ML/tree/master/BitPredict)
- This project is based on time series forecasting using different approaches.
- I have used bitcoin prices data and applied various approaches and models right from a naive approach to deep learning approaches.
- The most interesting part was to implement the N-BEATS papaer.
