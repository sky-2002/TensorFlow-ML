# TensorFlow-ML
A repository for my ML projects using tensorflow.

### 1. PubMedNLP
- This project is based on NLP, particularly sequential sentence classification as belonging to the #BACKGROUND, #CONCLUSION, #RESULT and other such sections 
of the papers in PubMEd RCT dataset. Classifying sentences in the abstracts can make them more organized and easy to read.
